**What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It keeps track of changes made to files and directories, enabling you to revert to previous versions if needed.


**Basic Terminologies**

Repository (Repo): A directory where Git stores all the files and their history.
Commit: A snapshot of your changes. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.
Branch: A separate line of development. The default branch is usually called main or master.
Merge: Combining changes from different branches.
Remote: A version of your repository hosted on the internet or network (e.g., GitHub).



**Basic Commands**

1. Setting Up Git
  Install Git:


   On Windows: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.

   On macOS: Use Homebrew: brew install git.
