**What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It keeps track of changes made to files and directories, enabling you to revert to previous versions if needed.

<br>

**Basic Terminologies**

Repository (Repo): A directory where Git stores all the files and their history.

Commit: A snapshot of your changes. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.

Branch: A separate line of development. The default branch is usually called main or master.

Merge: Combining changes from different branches.

Remote: A version of your repository hosted on the internet or network (e.g., GitHub).

**Basic Commands**

1. Setting Up Git
  Install Git:


   On Windows: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.

   On macOS: Use Homebrew: brew install git.

   On Linux: Use your package manager: sudo apt-get install git.

2. Configure Git:
   
        git config --global user.name "Your Name"

        git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com

<br>

3. Git Commands :
   

   3.1 Repository Commands

       3.1.1 Initialize a new repository:
             git init
     
       3.1.2 Clone an existing repository:
             git clone <repository-url>
           
       3.1.3 Forking an existing repository:
             git init
     

   3.2 Working with Files

       3.2.1 Check the status of your repository:
       git status

       3.2.2 Add files to the staging area:
       git add <file-name>
       git add .Â  

       3.2.3 Commit changes:
       git commit -m "Your commit message

       3.2.4 View commit history:
       git log
     



    3.3 Branching and Merging
  
        3.3.1 Create a new branch:
        git branch <branch-name>

        3.3.2 Switch to a branch:
        git checkout <branch-name

        3.3.3 Merge a branch into the current branch:
        git merge <branch-name>



    3.4 Working with Remotes
  
        3.4.1 Add a remote repository:
        git remote add origin <repository-url>

        3.4.2 Push changes to a remote repository::
        git push origin <branch-name>

        3.4.3 Pull changes from a remote repository:
        git pull origin <branch-name>
