# Introduction to Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating virtual instances of computing resources such as servers, operating systems, storage devices, or networks. It plays a crucial role in modern IT infrastructure, especially in cloud computing. When implementing virtualization—whether through virtual machines (VMs), containers, or bare-metal servers—three key factors must be considered: **Cost Efficiency**, **Security**, and **Resource Allocation**.

## a. Security Considerations

Virtual machines operate in isolated environments and do not have direct control over the host system. This isolation is enforced by the hypervisor, which acts as a security boundary between the host and the VMs. As a result, VMs can achieve a level of security comparable to that of dedicated physical servers.

## b. Resource Allocation

Hypervisors manage and allocate physical hardware resources—such as CPU, memory, and storage—to each virtual machine. This ensures efficient utilization of hardware while maintaining performance and isolation between VMs.

## c. Types of Virtualization

There are two primary types of hypervisor-based virtualization:

### i. Type 1 (Bare-Metal Hypervisor)


Hardware → Hypervisor → Virtual Machines


This type runs directly on the physical hardware and is commonly used in enterprise environments for its performance and security.

### ii. Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisor)

Hardware → Operating System → Hypervisor → Virtual Machines


This type runs on top of an existing operating system and is often used in development or testing environments. Many cloud providers prefer this model for its flexibility.

## d. Challenges in Virtual Machine Deployment

Deploying and managing virtual machines comes with several challenges:

- **Increased OS Overhead**: Each VM may require a separate OS, leading to higher operational costs for licensing, patching, and maintenance.
- **Resource Management**: Efficient allocation of resources is critical to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **Slow Boot Times**: VMs typically take longer to boot compared to containers or lightweight environments.
- **Unnecessary OS Components**: The guest OS may include many binaries and services that are not essential for the application, leading to inefficiencies.

## e. Benefits of Virtualization

Despite the challenges, virtualization offers significant advantages:

- **Scalability**: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand, improving flexibility and cost-efficiency.
- **Security**: Isolation between VMs enhances security and reduces the risk of system-wide breaches.

## f. Role of the Operating System

The operating system serves as a bridge between applications and hardware. It manages hardware resources and provides the necessary environment for applications to run effectively.


# 2. Introduction to Containerization

## a. What is a Container?

A container is an isolated operating system process that behaves similarly to a virtual machine (VM), but is much more lightweight.  
Unlike a full OS, a container includes only the application code and its dependencies—not the entire operating system.  
It serves as a standard unit of software that packages code along with all the libraries and settings required to run it reliably across different environments.

## b. Container Architecture Overview

[Container 1: App-1 + Dependencies]
[Container 2: App-2 + Dependencies]



## c. Types of Containers

- **LXC (Linux Containers)**
- **CRI-O**
- **Podman**
- **Rkt (Rocket)**
- **Apache Mesos** (also supports Windows containers)
- **Docker** (most widely used)

## d. Installing Docker

Docker is a popular container platform that uses `runc` as its default container runtime.  
It simplifies container creation, management, and orchestration.

## e. Linux Process Execution Flow

In a typical Linux system:

Process → System Call → Kernel → Hardware


For example, if **Process1** needs Python 2 and **Process2** needs Python 3, running both on the same system can cause conflicts.  
Containers solve this by isolating environments using **Namespaces**.

## f. Linux Kernel Features for Containers

- **Namespaces**: Isolate system resources (e.g., process IDs, network, file systems) so that each container sees its own set of resources.
- **cgroups (Control Groups)**: Limit and monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for a group of processes.

## g. Container Lifecycle and Docker Workflow

Developer → Writes Code → Adds to Dockerfile → Builds Docker Image → Runs Container


The **Dockerfile** defines the environment and dependencies needed to run the application.

## h. Docker Architecture

- **Docker CLI**: Command-line interface to interact with Docker.
- **Docker Daemon**: Receives commands from the CLI, translates them into HTTPS API calls, and manages containers.
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry where Docker images are stored and shared.
